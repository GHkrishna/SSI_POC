# SSI_POC
A PoC (Proof-of-Concept) of a Self-Sovereign Identity Solution, implemented using blockchain technology.

An SSI system is a decentralized identity management system. However, unlike a centralized identity provider, no single entity is responsible to manage credentials on behalf of the holder. Here, the holder are responsible to manage and distribute their identity. <br>

The system gives more autonomy to the user by decentralizing the power to one's own identity. Hence, the name Self-Sovereign.<br>

## Understanding SSI

An SSI System usually comprises three entities in the process:
1. **Issuer**: The entity responsible for issuing a credential. E.g.: RTO, Passport Authority, etc.
2. **Holder/Presenter**: The entity usually represents a nominal/ordinary person, the holder of the credential, issued by the verifier. The term 'holder' is referred to when credentials are received. The term 'presenter' specifies the role of presentation of the received credentials. E.g.: Driver (holding diver's license), Citizen (holding citizenship id of the respective nation).
3. **Verifier**: The entity requesting or validating the received proposal from the presenter of the credentials. E.g.: Insurance agency (providing insurance on the basics of credentials received from the presenter).

## The PoC

Our PoC tries to imitate the flow of the SSI system. It provides a platform for simulating the complete flow of how the credential flow might work in a real-world use case. <br>
